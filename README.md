- ExtendeD for Ndless



Installation:
************
- Install Ndless on your calculator
- send "ndoom.tns" to your calculator
- take Doom/DoomII compatible IWAD files and change their extensions from ".wad" to ".wad.tns"
- send the ".wad.tns" files to your calculator
- if necessary, add a "ext.wad=ndoom" line to your "ndless.cfg.tns" file



Supported games:
***************
There exists two types of WAD files:
- IWAD files which include complete game data
- PWAD files which are patches with partial data, designed to be loaded over an IWAD

nDoom mainly targets IWAD files and has partial support for PWAD files.
Note that most 3rd party WAD files available on the Internet are PWAD files and won't work.

Only IWAD/PWAD files compatible with the Doom or Doom II original engine are supported. IWAD/PWAD files from other Id Software games (Heretic, Hexen...) won't work.

The Id Software supported IWAD files are:
- Doom ShareWare 	(usually "doom1.wad")		(Doom IWAD format)
- Doom registered	(usually "doom.wad")		(Doom IWAD format)
- Ultimate Doom		(usually "doomu.wad")		(Doom IWAD format)
- Doom II		(usually "doom2.wad")		(Doom II IWAD format)
- Final Doom - Plutonia	(usually "plutonia.wad")	(Doom II IWAD format)
- Final Doom - TNT	(usually "tnt.wad")		(Doom II IWAD format)

New in version 2.11 (28/01/2012):
*******************************

in order to be able to open more PWAD files (with some graphic glitches)


New in version 2.12 (06/02/2012):
********************************

if the game does crash, that's another problem...

- TI-Nspire CX CR4 new screen support

New in version 2.4 (19/09/2020):

Todo list:
*********
- Need to fix the error dialog boxes bug once the game has started (which should not happen) - freeze after the dialog box instead of quit.
- Need to fix end of episode/game animations which seem to freeze sometimes
